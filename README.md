# AppDevRiffat-sCuisine

This is a README file.

In this file will contain a few explanations and just a bit understanding of project

Accounts to test application with are seen and provided in main.dart

## Incomplete features and parts 
- API
- Checkout, complete-ish. Completed but on wrong page
- Extra features for user manipulation


## Things that are imporant and will be added later on
- Missing Content
- API, Location Fethching

Yeah that's all. Doing this alone helped showed me my weakness and streghts on working alone
Working with more people would be better in task completion but, I'm tired of bad teamates.
Sorry there are missing details, but I hope you can see the potential it has.
For example admin order page is empty but normaly it would show all orders, if the checkout was saved to a file for example. Sorry!
